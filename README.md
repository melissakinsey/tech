# Portfolio Project

## Description

This portfolio is for Melissa Kinsey, a technical writer in St. Louis, Missouri (hey, don't blame me—I just live here). The site consists of five pages, three of which were originally built as a homework assignment for the Columbia University Engineering Full-Stack Boot Camp (October 2020-April 2021).

\*Home ("About" page): This page was the most difficult for me. I couldn't get the page to be responsive. The page works better now, but I'll continue to work on it.

\*Portfolio: In addition to tech writing, I do some hobby writing now and then for Slate and other online sites (that is, when I'm not also enrolled in a programming boot camp 20 hours a week). The Portfolio page features my Slate stories.

\*GitHub: This page features some projects I've done in class. The apps are amateurish, for sure, but not bad for having built each of them in a week, right? The Quarantinis app was a group project.

\*Tech Writing: This page features some of my tech writing samples. I'm careful not to violate any NDA I've signed, so I tried to password protect this page using a .htaccess file. It didn't work. These samples don't give away any trade secrets, though, so I think it's safe to post them publicly. (No doubt the foreign governments following my GitHub will be disappointed.)

\*Contact (form): Call me! 867-5309. I've got a blank space, baby. And I'll write your name.
