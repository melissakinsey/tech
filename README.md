# Techical Writing Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my GitHub! I originally built this portfolio as a homework assignment for the Columbia University Engineering Full-Stack Boot Camp (October 2020-April 2021). I've been a senior technical writer at Amazon (Devices & Services â€“ Alexa) for 2 years, and I've updated this site to highlight some of that more recent work.

Read on to learn about each page. 

\*Tech Writing: This page features some of my tech writing samples. I've modified certain content to avoid exposing any proprietary company data.

\*Portfolio: In addition to tech writing, I've done some hobby writing for Slate and other online sites. The Portfolio page features my Slate stories.

\*GitHub Projects: This page features some projects I created during my coding boot camp. The apps are a bit clunky, but not bad for having built each of them in a week, right? The Quarantinis app was a group project.

\*Infographics: I enjoy using Photoshop to create infographics. Most of the images on this page appear in Alexa Learning Lab courses. I've also included a couple of UML-style diagrams I created for Spectrum.

\*Logos: This page shows the logos I designed for the many team Confluence pages I put together at Bayer Crop Science. I've also included a boot camp logo, an Amazon Confluence page logo, and the header for my Slack channel, #grammar-medics.

\*Contact (form): Enough said.
